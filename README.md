# TDD offers many different benefits and weaknesses for software development. Some of its benefits include being able to ensure overall better code quality since you are able to find bugs and flaws within the code early on before deployment. Another benefit is that it can help with debugging to again catch problems early on in development before the code becomes complex and it becomes harder to debug for errors. Some weaknesses for TDD include requirement time investment, as it takes more time to write code for testing in addition to the code for the project compared to just writing the code for the project. Another problem is that there’s no guarantee that all possible test cases and errors will be covered, as the testing is written by the developers at the end of the day and it’s possible for the program to still have bugs in areas where the developers didn’t think would have bugs.
